# Abora-White

Abora-White is an implementation of the Abora server written in Java
and based on the Udanax-Gold source.

The process of writing Abora-White is to start from a clean project
then iteratively:

- Port a small portion of Udanax-Gold - from my Java Abora-Gold auto-translated version
- Convert to a Java friendly naming, programming idioms and use of existing Java features and libraries
- Write JUnit test to help me understand the implementation and check the port
- Write JavaDoc and summary documentation


## Building and Testing

Currently there is not much to look at, but you can build and run
tests on the code if you have Java + Maven installed.

    mvn clean install
