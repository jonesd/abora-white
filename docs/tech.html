		<p><font color="red">---- Document still being written ----</font></p>


		<p>The author recognizes the need for good technical documentation
		to enable others to be able to have any hope of applying Abora to
			their own problems. Please don't be put off by the early state
			of the following documents, things will improve!</p>

<h3>Infrastructure</h3>


		<p>The core of the software is a generic server that supports
		documents/data structures, sharing of and linking between,
		versioning, notification of various changes, access control, and
		communication with other servers.</p>

		<p>The server provides a service at a relatively low level and
		generic level. There is an expectation that it will be very rare
		for developers to have to modify the server.</p>

		<p>The server is hopefully going to be based on a translated
		version of the open-source Udanax-Gold code converted into Java by
		a combination of one-off automated-translation followed by hand
		tweaking. If this doesn't prove feasible then a coded from scratch
		implementation will be considered as an extension of my earlier
		dolphin prototype work, though this will have to have a severely
		reduced set of features compared with Udanax-Gold. The java
		version may be hosted in JBoss for transaction/persistence support
		though that is open to change.</p>

		<p>A network of servers should eventually be supported. A client
		would typically communicate with a single server, and that server
		in turn would communicate with other servers to retrieve external
		documents. A user could run a server on their own machine to
		support working while disconnected from the server network.</p>

		<p>Beyond the server are a number of front-end/client applications. </p>

		<p>Front-Ends communicate with the server using a platform and
		language neutral client API. This can be local or network access.
		Messages can be in a compact binary format for runtime
		performance, or an XML version for debugging and more open
		access.</p>

		<p>The client API appears to be pretty complicated and most
		naturally supported by OOP languages, though at a low-level the
		existing functionality appears to fall back to a single list of C
		like function calls.</p>

		<p>One type of front-end could be a webserver gateway. This would
		enable a website to use the abora back-end to present HTML pages.
		A basic version of this could support viewing and simple editing.
		Application developers could then build on this to provide
		application specific features, formatting, etc.</p>

		<p>Thick client would enable more sophisticated editing, and could
		enable existing stand-alone applications to use the server by
		supporting the client API. A basic version could be supplied that
		supports all the raw features and perhaps support for notes/web
		links/diary/etc. Custom versions could extend from this.</p>

		<p>Simple command-line driven front-ends could provide some
		straight forward access for automated manipulation and weak
		integration with existing applications. This might support
		importing of entire documents, retrieving entire documents at a
		content level, and perhaps back-up support. </p>

		<p>Indexing of words/terms such as Google provides is not part of
		the core server. Even with the sophisticated linking supported by
		the server, indexing will be a critical feature. Indexing
		front-ends would be used to trawl the server documents in a
		similar way to HTML indexing. I don't know if these index
		structures would be stored in turn in the server, and if access to
		them could be direct or via the indexer front-end.</p>


<h3>Building with Ant</h3>

		<p>The application uses the Ant open-source make-like tool to
			script the compile, tests, javadoc, metrics generation and other
			tasks.</p>

<h3>Developing with Eclipse</h3>

		<p>The author is developing the project code using the Eclipse
			open-source IDE.</p>

	<p>TODO: .project resources, templates to ease writing.</p>

<h3>Programming Patterns</h3>

<h4>Object Creation</h4>

		<p>Object creation is requested using static factory methods
		rather than directly calling constructors. This is an often used
		pattern that has a few benefits; factory methods can have names,
		they gain flexibility by being able to return subclasses of the
		declared type and also they can re-use existing objects if
		required.</p>

		<p>The default name for the factory methods is <tt>make</tt>
		though there are some more descriptively named cases as well.</p>

		<p>Some simple examples of its usage:<br>
<pre>	IntegerValue nine = IntegerValue.make(9);
	IntegerValue zero = IntegerValue.zero();</pre>

		<p>Constructors are obviously still used under the covers, and are
		often marked as <tt>protected</tt> to discourage their direct
		calling.</p>

		<p>TODO: References, why the name make, are there any idoms for
		naming these factories beyond make, problems with return
		inheritance, rehydrating with the Rcvr constructor.</p>

<h4>Steppers</h4>

		<p>Steppers are an implementation of the iterator pattern, that is
			present in Java as the Enumeration and Iterator interfaces.</p>
