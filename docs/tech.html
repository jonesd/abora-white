<h1>Abora-White Technical Documentation</h1>

		<p>...more to come...</p>

<h3>Infrastructure</h3>


		<p>The core of the software is a generic server that supports documents/data structures, sharing of and linking between, versioning, notification of various changes, access control, and communication with other servers.</p>

		<p>The server provides a service at a relatively low level and generic level. There is an expectation that it will be very rare for developers to have to modify the server.</p>

		<p>The server is hopefully going to be based on a translated version of the open-source Udanax-Gold code converted into Java by a combination of one-off automated-translation followed by hand tweaking. If this doesn't prove feasible then a coded from scratch implementation will be considered as an extension of my earlier dolphin prototype work, though this will have to have a severely reduced set of features compared with Udanax-Gold. The java version may be hosted in JBoss for transaction/persistence support though that is open to change.</p>

		<p>A network of servers should eventually be supported. A client would typically communicate with a single server, and that server in turn would communicate with other servers to retrieve external documents. A user could run a server on their own machine to support working while disconnected from the server network.</p>

		<p>Beyond the server are a number of front-end/client applications. </p>

		<p>Front-Ends communicate with the server using a platform and language neutral client API. This can be local or network access. Messages can be in a compact binary format for runtime performance, or an XML version for debugging and more open access.</p>

		<p>The client API appears to be pretty complicated and most naturally supported by OOP languages, though at a low-level the existing functionality appears to fall back to a single list of C like function calls.</p>

		<p>One type of front-end could be a webserver gateway. This would enable a website to use the abora back-end to present HTML pages. A basic version of this could support viewing and simple editing. Application developers could then build on this to provide application specific features, formatting, etc.</p>

	<p>Thick client would enable more sophisticated editing, and could enable existing stand-alone applications to use the server by supporting the client API. A basic version could be supplied that supports all the raw features and perhaps support for notes/web links/diary/etc. Custom versions could extend from this.</p>

		<p>Simple command-line driven front-ends could provide some straight forward access for automated manipulation and weak integration with existing applications. This might support importing of entire documents, retrieving entire documents at a content level, and perhaps back-up support. </p>

	<p>Indexing of words/terms such as Google provides is not part of the core server. Even with the sophisticated linking supported by the server, indexing will be a critical feature. Indexing front-ends would be used to trawl the server documents in a similar way to HTML indexing. I don't know if these index structures would be stored in turn in the server, and if access to them could be direct or via the indexer front-end.</p>
