				<p>The Abora-White sub-project is a Java implementation of the
				Udanax-Gold server that has been auto-translated from the
				original Smalltalk, and then manually converted for a better
				fit with the Java world.</p>

			<p>The aim is to get some useful subset of the Udanax-Gold server
		running, and to end up with a code base that as much as possible
		will provide a base from which other developers can call from
		their applications or even build on. To help with this, efforts are
		being expended on; reasonable JavaDoc and overview documents, JUnit test
		cases, and simple example applications.</p>
