<h1>Porting from Udanax-Gold</h1>

		<p>In porting Udanax-Gold from Smalltalk to the Java based
		Abora-White a number of issues have come up. For example Smalltalk
			integers are efficiently encoded as object references within 30
			bits or so of size and will transparently expand to large
			integer objects beyond that size, whereas Java int's will not
			expand beyond their max values, and BigIntegers are second-class
			citizens at the syntax level. So what should the Java conversion
			do? The purpose of this page is to document these problems and
			the final outcome I have chosen for Abora-White.</p>

<h3>IntegerVar and BooleanVar</h3>

<h3>Java Primitive Data Types</h3>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<h3>Potential Bugs</h3>

		<p>During the course of porting from Udanax-Gold a number of
		potential bugs have been found. This happened by either close
		reading of the code or by creating JUnit tests for the code. I
		felt it was useful to list my discoveries here; to help me later
		when I might run into problems with code relying on this, help
		others who may attempt a port of Udanax-Gold to other systems, and
		for the active readers amongst you to double check my claims and
		hopefully show me that I was wrong.</p>

		<p>I have listed these items as <i>potential</i> bugs as I could
		well be mistaken about the original purpose of the code,
		overlooking details of the Smalltalk/X++ low level implementation
		or quite possible gross user incompetence on my side.</p>

		<p>As a closing statement, I hope nobody takes offence at
		producing such a list, I clearly have great respect for
		Udanax-Gold to even consider spending this amount of time on it,
		and we all know that no reasonable application can be defect
		free.</p>
